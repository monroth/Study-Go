# Study-Go
Code I wrote during studying Go

For now, only test problems from my friend. Both tasks and solutions are in subfolders of testProblems folder.

If you want to solve them yourself, then I suggest reading Basics here first https://go.dev/tour/list. In my opinion problems are ordered in order of increasing difficulty as follows: helloWorld, romanNumbers, stringCount, forthOne, LRUCache, consoleHTTPFetch, binaryTree, gaussNumbers, chiperStream
